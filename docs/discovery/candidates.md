# OSS agent-skill / MCP candidates — discovery shortlist

> Generated Phase 0 of the "mine most-starred OSS → improve profiles" plan.
> Source: direct `gh search repos --sort=stars` sweeps + `cue discover`. The
> `cue discover` gem-scorer caps at ~1.6k★ (tuned for *hidden* gems), so the
> star-sorted sweep below is the authoritative "most-starred" list.
> **Status: awaiting your go/no-go before anything is wired.**

## Trust tiers (Phase-0 supply-chain vet)

- 🟢 **Official** — maintained by Anthropic / Vercel / Microsoft / GitHub / Google / Upstash. Low supply-chain risk.
- 🟡 **Reputable community** — well-known author, high stars. Read `allowed-tools` per skill before wiring (deferred to the Phase-2 pre-wire gate).
- 🟠 **Niche / vet-hard** — security tooling or low-profile author; deep read required before wiring.
- 📚 **List/framework** — not wired directly; a *source* to cherry-pick from or port techniques.

## Recommended first wave (broad sweep, gap-driven targeting in Phase 1)

**Adopt (8):** playwright-mcp, mcp-toolbox, Figma-Context-MCP (MCPs); addyosmani/agent-skills, kepano/obsidian-skills, mvanhorn/last30days-skill, SawyerHood/dev-browser, Claude-OSINT (skills).

**Port (3):** obra/superpowers → meta skills; github/awesome-copilot → prompt patterns; anthropics/skills → expand coverage.

**Mine as source (4 lists):** awesome-mcp-servers, ComposioHQ/awesome-claude-skills, antigravity-awesome-skills, modelcontextprotocol/servers.

## Vet gate still owed before wiring (Phase 2, per repo)
Read each adopted skill's `allowed-tools` + body / each MCP's `command`+`args`:
- 🟠 `elementalsouls/Claude-OSINT` — security/recon tooling; confirm no auto-exfil, scope `Bash(*)`.
- 🟡 community skills — confirm tool scope is justified, pin `repo` to a tag/sha to stop drift.
- MCPs — confirm npx package name + that secrets are `${ENV}` placeholders only.
